Auto-shifting:
Goal: up and downshift automatically.

Depends on what variables?
- speed
- acceleration

When do we upshift?
- prolonged positive acceleration
- over certain speed

When do we downshift?
- prolonged negative acceleration
- under certain speed

Solenoid shifter
boolean inHighGear

setHighGear(boolean highGear)
if(highGear != inHighGear)
    inHighGear = highGear
    shifter.set(!highGear)

For turret:
- solenoid off by default blocking access to the shooter
- access to shooter always blocked unless shooting wheel is up to speed
- need to measure recovery time

when joystick input says shoot:
rotate turret to target
get shooter up to speed
once shooter is up to speed, open ball gate
after ball has been shot, close ball gate
repeat
if shoot input ever goes away, stop process
