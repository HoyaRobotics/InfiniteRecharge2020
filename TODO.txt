Auto-shifting:
Goal: up and downshift automatically.

Depends on what variables?
- speed
- acceleration

When do we upshift?
- prolonged positive acceleration
- over certain speed

When do we downshift?
- prolonged negative acceleration
- under certain speed

Solenoid shifter
boolean inHighGear

setHighGear(boolean highGear)
if(highGear != inHighGear)
    inHighGear = highGear
    shifter.set(!highGear)

For turret:
- solenoid off by default blocking access to the shooter
- access to shooter always blocked unless shooting wheel is up to speed
- need to measure recovery time
